1. Fix up documentation at the beginning

2. Create a man page

3. Add options for modes and symmetry for the different functions

4. Check for existing nodes

5. Add support to read from files (command line or a load command or both?)

6. Pass the graph as an arguement to the functions - should this be converted into a class?

7. Add a command to print details of the topology and nodes so far

8. Add shorthand * for the commands

9. Factor out macros and headers, add guards

10. Deal with edge cases - 0, 1 nodes

11. Default behaviour for + a b

12. Error handling in UDFs

13. Remove node size checks inside functions
